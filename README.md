# Hangman

The Hangman Game is a classic word-guessing game implemented in Python. This simple text-based game allows players to guess letters in a hidden word. With each correct guess, the word is gradually revealed, and with each incorrect guess, a player loses one of his 5 lives. The goal is to guess the word before running out of lives.

This is a practical project which is part of my full-time Data Engineering bootcamp.

## Features

- Randomly selects a word from a list of predefined words.
- Keeps track of the word to be guessed and the player's progress.
- Allows players to guess a single alphabetical character.
- Provides feedback on whether the guess is correct and updates the word progress.
- Limits the number of lives, and the game ends when the player runs out of lives.
- Prevents duplicate guesses and provides prompts for valid input.

## How to Play

1. Clone the repository or download the Hangman game code.

2. Run the Python script to start the game.

3. You'll be presented with a word to guess, displayed as underscores (e.g., "_ _ _ _ _"). The number of underscores corresponds to the number of letters in the word.

4. Enter a single alphabetical character as your guess and press Enter.

5. The game will inform you if your guess is correct and update the word display.

6. Continue making guesses until you correctly guess the entire word or run out of lives.

7. The game ends when you either win by guessing the word or lose by running out of lives.

## Customization

You can customize the game by modifying the list of words, changing the number of lives, or adding new features as per your preferences.
